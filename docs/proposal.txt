Pain Points:
	Many students avoid asking questions or seeking help publicly because they fear being judged or appearing incompetent in front of peers or instructors. Course forums like Ed or Piazza are instructor-monitored and often limited to class topics, so students feel exposed and restricted. Meanwhile, informal group chats such as Discord or WhatsApp are noisy, unorganized, and difficult to search, causing useful answers to get buried. Beyond coursework, students also struggle to find safe, campus-only spaces to discuss personal or cross-cutting issues like housing, visas, mental health, or career advice. In this way,  first-years, international students, and those without established social circles do not have a reliable platform to ask questions, share experiences, or get timely help.

Solution:
    Our proposed solution is to build a Columbia and Barnard only SSO web app where posts are anonymous by default and real identities are never shown. Each thread assigns a pseudonym, and moderators and campus resource staff have role flags so actions are auditable. Authoring starts with a simple composer with topic picker and tags. Before posting, the system checks for duplicates using title and body similarity and shows a draft preview. Posts are anonymous by default with an option to reveal a name later.
    The product enforces a structured Q&A model. One question can have many answers, and each answer can have comments. Askers can mark an accepted answer. Upvotes count only from verified campus accounts. Edit history is stored, and the thread locks when an answer is accepted. Quality controls require minimal fields and correct tags. The composer suggests similar posts and relevant resource cards. Rate limits curb spam. Safety combines AI and human review. The AI pre-screen flags toxicity, self harm, hate, and spam. One tap reporting sends items to a human queue with clear escalation. Moderators can redact content. Authors may mark a post as ephemeral with expiry between seven and thirty days. Search supports full text with filters for tag, course, school, time, and solved status. A weekly digest highlights the best answers. Staff can merge duplicates so future searches land on a single canonical thread.
    Sensitive categories trigger resource routing. A side panel shows official links and office hours for Counseling, ODS, ISSO, and Public Safety so students reach credible help quickly. The MVP centers on clear funnels: ask, de-dupe, answer, accept, and archive for reuse. If possible and time permits, we would also like to include a “Marketplace” board for second-hand listings limited to verified students. Listings use pseudonymous direct messages. Contact details are revealed only with mutual consent. A checklist reminds students how to meet safely on campus.
    The MVP will use Ruby on Rails with Postgres and Omniauth for SSO. We will write Cucumber user stories for key flows and RSpec unit tests for models and services. Deployment will be on Heroku with a minimal JavaScript frontend.

Who our project is for:
    Any Columbia/Barnard student who needs help without social risk. Especially useful for freshmen, international students, and anyone outside established networks who need low-risk help on academics and campus life. They benefit from anonymity, quick answers, and searchable guidance that is campus verified. Other users include transfer students, commuters, students changing majors, and cross-registrants. They face similar gaps in information and community and need a trusted place to ask and learn. Key contributors are peer mentors, RAs, student organization leaders, and TAs who can provide credible answers and curate resource cards. Typical questions include whether a course load is realistic, how to renew an F-1 visa, how to find roommates, the accommodations process, lab etiquette, and buying or selling used items safely on campus.

Why our project is unique/different from existing solutions:
	Reddit is an open, global discussion platform where anyone can create or join communities. While it fosters diverse conversations, its public nature often discourages vulnerable or personal questions, especially from students worried about visibility and judgment. Discussions are conversational and fragmented, making useful answers hard to find once buried under new posts. Also, Reddit’s model rewards engagement and popularity rather than trust or accuracy, which can lead to noise, misinformation and social pressure that undermine its usefulness for sensitive and campus-specific support.
	On the other hand, our application is designed specifically for verified Columbia/Barnard students, combining anonymity, structure and campus trust. Unlike Reddit’s open forums, it is SSO-gated and anonymous by default. So students can ask any academic, personal or practical question without social risk. Posts follow a structured Q&A format with tags, duplicate detection, accepted answers and searchable archives, turning conversations into a lasting knowledge base. AI pre-moderation and human review ensure safety and civility, while sensitive topics automatically surface official campus resources. By prioritizing privacy, safety and accessibility, our application builds a trustworthy, inclusive and enduring community that Reddit’s public architecture cannot achieve.

Why this differentiation matters:
    Campus-verified anonymous platforms succeed because students trust peers in identical situations. Someone navigating the same visa process, facing the same housing deadlines, or taking the same professor understands the stakes. Blind, the professional networking app, proves this model works. Employees post anonymously while their company name shows. Coworkers trust advice because verification guarantees the person shares their workplace reality. Our application applies this model to Columbia and Barnard. Students post anonymously while their school affiliation displays. Every post stays within the Columbia/Barnard community, creating a trusted boundary.
    This verification enables far more than Q&A. Students can chat anonymously about sensitive topics, explore dating within a trusted campus community, or buy and sell items safely through school-verified marketplace listings. The campus boundary creates accountability without exposing personal identity. AI pre-screening catches harmful content before posting. Crisis keywords trigger immediate Counseling and Public Safety routing. Structured Q&A with accepted answers preserves knowledge permanently. Students delete posts when needed but accepted answers stay findable. Complete anonymity prevents retaliation. School verification ensures every interaction happens within a trusted, accountable community.
