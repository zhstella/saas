# CU Blue Board – Verified community. Anonymous voice.

## Team Members (Group 8)
- Chih-Hsin Chen (`cc5240`)
- Seung Jae Hong (`sh4546`)
- Mingliang Yu (`my2899`)
- Yujia Zhai (`yz5133`)

## Project Pitch
- Video: https://youtu.be/9S1olW0Fe4o
- Proposal: see `/docs/proposal.txt`

## Prerequisites
- Ruby `3.2.2` (see `.ruby-version`)
  - Recommended: install via `rbenv` → `brew install rbenv ruby-build`, `rbenv install 3.2.2`, `rbenv local 3.2.2`
- Bundler (`gem install bundler`)
- SQLite 3 (ships with macOS/Linux)

## Local Setup
1. Ensure Bundler is available: `gem install bundler`
2. Install project gems: `bundle install`
3. Prepare the database: `bin/rails db:prepare`
   - Alternatively run `bin/setup` once; it installs gems, prepares the DB, and launches the dev server.

### Running the app
1. Start the server: `rails server`
2. Open the browser at http://localhost:3000

### Default flows covered in Iteration 1
- Browse a feed of posts anonymously, including keyword search without revealing identities
- Register/log in via Devise to get a pseudonymous identity
- Create new questions with title/body validation
- Delete posts you authored with confirmation guardrails
- Reply to a post through comments and remove your own comments
- Toggle likes on posts while preventing duplicate likes per user
- Display pseudonymous handles instead of email addresses on posts and comments

## Test Suites
```bash
# RSpec unit/request coverage
bundle exec rspec

# Cucumber executable user stories
bundle exec cucumber
```

**RSpec coverage**
- Examples cover models, requests, and helpers (all green).
- `spec/models/post_spec.rb`: post validations and keyword search helper.
- `spec/models/comment_spec.rb`: comment presence/association checks.
- `spec/models/like_spec.rb`: uniqueness constraint and helper methods.
- `spec/models/user_spec.rb`: anonymous handle generation and associations.
- `spec/requests/posts_spec.rb`: create and delete posts with proper authorization + flashes.
- `spec/requests/comments_spec.rb`: delete comments with ownership checks and redirects.
- `spec/requests/likes_spec.rb`: like/unlike actions with authentication checks.
- `spec/helpers/application_helper_spec.rb`: display_author pseudonym helper.

**Cucumber scenarios**
- 5 scenarios / 28 steps covering the primary user journeys.
- `features/posts/browse_posts.feature`: anonymous feed browsing, search filtering, identity masking.
- `features/posts/create_post.feature`: sign-up/login flow and successful post creation.
- `features/comments/add_comment.feature`: authenticated commenting and flash message.
- `features/posts/like_post.feature`: like/unlike toggle with count updates.

### Test Coverage

This project uses [SimpleCov](https://github.com/simplecov-ruby/simplecov) to measure test coverage. The coverage approach and configuration were adapted from **COMS W4152 hw-tdd** (Codio 8.9 CHIPS: The Acceptance Test/Unit Test Cycle).

After running both test suites, view the coverage report:

```bash
open coverage/index.html
```

**Target:** 90%+ statement coverage
**Local test results:** 94.23% line coverage, 94.44% branch coverage

Running the test suites will generate a detailed coverage report in `coverage/index.html`.

## Deployment
- Heroku: https://cu-blueboard-27a6a02ee825.herokuapp.com/
- Source code: https://github.com/zhstella/CU_Blueboard

## Additional Materials
- Iteration artifacts (such as proposal.txt) are stored in `/docs` as the project evolves.
